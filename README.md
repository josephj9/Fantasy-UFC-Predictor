# Fantasy-UFC-Predictor
Welcome to the Fantasy UFC Predictor! This project aims to predict the outcomes of UFC fights using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description
The Fantasy UFC Predictor is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the outcomes of UFC fights. By analyzing historical fight data, fighter statistics, and various other features, the predictor aims to provide accurate predictions for upcoming fights.

For this project, I
• Developed a web-based Fantasy Fight Predictor using TensorFlow, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React, enabling real-time fight outcome predictions
based on fighter statistics.

• Trained a deep learning model with advanced feature engineering on UFC fight data, improving prediction accuracy using a neural network
with scaled inputs.

• Built a full-stack system integrating a Flask API, PostgreSQL database for fighter profiles, and a React UI for user interaction, ensuring
seamless data flow and accessibility.

## Features
- **Fight Outcome Predictions**: Predict the winner of UFC fights based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize fighter statistics and fight outcomes.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface for inputting fight details and viewing predictions.

## How To Use
First, select two fighters from the drop-down menu!
